@KevinPaulGregg @duty2warn @gtconway3d Ah but Trump is wrong about that, too. He lost the votes that gave Dems the House in 2018. He's lost races for chosen candidates.

Here's exactly how we could have contained #coronavirus. Note the use of information infrastructrue to keep everone informed, rapid testing, inter-agency coordination.  Looks like #Taiwan and #Singapore did everthing right. https://t.co/QZqtYuILR6
@IntelOperator In tort key question is whether the wrong done is the proximate cause of the injury suffered. Ask: "But for Trump's #coronavirus response, would I  have been hurt?" If answer = "no," his conduct caused the harm. E.g. If waiting for a ventilator in #NYC, #China's not your problem.

What Trump et al. don't get: National #coronavirus #testing will drive mumbers of cases way up but allow #tracing. E.g. 3 meat plants + 5 nursing homes =80% of area cases. Then officials know where to impose targeted, not universal, #quarantine.You can't put out an unseen fire.

This is not science, just estimates using math... If #coronavirus is infecting about 10% of people, that means about 750 million people will get it in the world, based on a 7.5 billion population. And about 4% of people infected have died based on current WHO stats.

The craziest thing about #COVID19 is that this pandemic will be a part of humanity forever. No, really. Viruses code their DNA into ours when they use our cells for reproduction, so much so that around 8% of the human genome is viral DNA. This will be a part of us forever...
Every government official is giving recommendations about what to do in response to the #COVID„Éº19 #CoronaVirus as if each of these things are easy. But we know it is going to be hard.

Wish our local media in Yuma dug into the statistics like this more, instead of just reporting the number of new cases &amp; deaths. Lots of disconcerting stats to be uncovered (Somerton‚Äôs 85350 has positives equal to 1.6% of the population. Yuma Co accounting for 10%+ new AZ cases) https://t.co/ToRMXFges3
BASEBALL SUSPENDED!MLB has suspended all baseball operations indefinitely Spring training is to be canceled as of tomorrow, and season will not start until...What are your thoughts?#CoronaVirus #COVD19 #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak @Mariners @Seahawks https://t.co/K3FZMmBGs3
Rt this. Politicians and celebrities believe they are more equal than us with #Covid19Test kits. I find it disgusting that they use that while tell us we need to be patient on our test kits. We are more equal #coronavirus #CoronavirusPandemic #TrumpPlague
Did you guys know that we used to be teachers in the Navajo nation for about four years? We loved everything from blue mush, Navajo bread,  and their beautiful Dine people. ‚ù§Ô∏è #NavajoStrong #NavajoNation #NewMexico #COVID19 https://t.co/e2pc6kDIeI
Panic food buying, no parking at grocery, no milk or eggs, long lines at checkout, carts loaded with snacks #coronavirus
Just had the opportunity to listen and learn via @zoom_us from @BlainWatson of @ComptonUnified. Amazing leadership and work being done...even through the challenges of #COVID19. Thanks for connecting us @TravisJBristol! More to come. #NeverWhisperJustice https://t.co/kXNLVd90hV
Just 2 weeks ago NYC had 300 cases of Coronavirus. Today they have about 50,000. That's how fast this can spread. #coronavirus
@NickKristof Agreed! I have recommended this audiobook to every person I have spoken to (every zoom meeting) since starting it. I‚Äôm thinking about all the people who don‚Äôt have a safety net for #covid19 üò¢

@Acyn Fox should be taken off the air for lying to Americans and jeopardizing their lives. #COVID19
I‚Äôd hate to think there‚Äôs a link between Trump‚Äôs white nationalist ties, Trump‚Äôs Coronavirus responses, and this data. #25theAmendmentNow #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #coronavirus #COVID19 https://t.co/rhhexbPhrI
Is that including the wide scale outbreak you‚Äôre going to have in @AZCorrections? https://t.co/6qE077Bkex

Our nation's #COVID19 response must prioritize public health, workers, the environment, and democracy. https://t.co/KLHcup4Hzx
Stay home please if everyone just did this .. 2or 3 weeks we will be fine https://t.co/CtBFJMaf9G
We should be talking about how we are going to protect employees from #COVID19, more testing and providing PPE in the workplace without putting a strain on supplies of PPE for healthcare workers. https://t.co/N86chbknoS
So sure go play in the BEACH! https://t.co/WQWBBHvJRF

Let that sink in. January 20, 2020‚Äî the day that the US &amp; South Korea both had their first positive cases of #COVID19‚Äî will never and should never be forgotten in history books. This is the result of failed leadership. It‚Äôs catastrophic. https://t.co/GwDw4F2v6z

No @TravisGrantham that is fallacious. Your number merely represents the number of confirmed cases. At one point, China and Italy had the same stat. So.... https://t.co/L6wgnbJV1M
