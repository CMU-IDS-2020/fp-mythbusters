Italy has just lost almost 800 people in one day. Infections and deaths are still exponential and not at their peak. Both Italy and the US had slow responses to #COVID19 and are seen to be having the same dynamics per new infections. Trump called it a hoax and waited 3 wks.

With talk about how many #deaths are attributed to other conditions as a way to downplay the risk of #COVID19 should highlight gaps in society associated with death tolls of said conditions. Instead, they use it to justify their selfish greed, driving them to #reopen prematurely.

People are dying because of lack of PPE. For the cost of just a few dollars, or even pennies, people are dying. Money is king, and it rules us without logic or reason. Take a good look, people, this is who we really are. Wear a mask. And stay home.#COVID19#GetMePPE

MSM &amp; Dr. Fauci quick to point out, there's no proof #chloraquine works against #covid19. Curiously, they have not also mentioned there's no proof lockdowns and destroying the economy are better solutions to this disease than the #commonsense protocols employed by #Sweden.

@1980Dorothy @MidloDem @DetroitSteel_ Testing mostly tells you whether you need to COMPLETELY isolate.Also, you'd be suprised how often "treatment" in medicine is just managing the symptoms anyway. It's just that with #COVID19, the symptoms get SO severe, SO fast.
