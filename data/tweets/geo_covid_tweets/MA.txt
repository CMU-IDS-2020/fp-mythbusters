Death rate is reported as deaths/cases. This is not meaningful, as most cases are still pending. Far more illuminating is deaths over RESOLVED cases, ie deaths/(deaths+recoveries). That’s far closer to the real probability of death if you get #COVID19 and currently is scary high.

President Trump says no deaths from #Covid19 are acceptable; maintains the problems with the virus are contained to high population areas, and he “disagrees” with testing everyone in the nation, saying it’s “ridiculous” - says we don’t have to test “whole states” in Midwest

#drphil i am currently in quarantine in Boston. I live alone, w/my fish &amp; frogs in 1 tank. I also recently broke my clavicle, a couple of ribs, &amp; a small bone in my back. So hard 2 not have any help or company especially when even a shower is excruciating #COVID19
#Covid19  Be calm, do what can be done, then do more: better. Don't think of December 1941 ... that happened, so did seemingly crazy stuff, but the job was done.

So we're just going to pretend that cost of living isn't a thing? Look, $1,200 is nice and all but that money goes a lot further in places like parts of the south than on the coasts. Basing #coronavirus payments on cost of living would've been a good idea.

Pro tip for #covid19 I haven't seen yet: wear glasses instead of contacts! If you are like me, work long days in front of a screen, and have dry eyes by day's end, you probably rub your eyes. Skip the contacts, wear your glasses. Even if it makes you self-conscious like me.

How about we declassify the intelligence reports to Trump so we can see what Trump knew and when he knew it. As usual, he’s trying to blame others for his failures. https://t.co/iwldCgAnv5

.@POTUS is asking Congress for $50 billion to help provide economic loans to affected states and help small businesses. Also wants to provide Americans with payroll tax relief #7news #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaOutbreak #COVID19
So there will be thousands and thousands of people who can’t or won’t get treatment/testing because of the cost incurred from #coronavirus. But somehow warmer weather will make this all go away. Testing treatment and other costs should be waived if this will be mitigated.
I would have never believed if you had told me in 2019 that @NCBS_Bangalore @DBT_inStem institutions primarily doing great fundamental research, will be running #COVID19 testing during #pandemic, never would have believed. Great infrastructure and people can do wonders! https://t.co/jkG0zTJS9b

I have no idea where I came into contact with #coronavirus. None of my friends, family, or colleagues feel sick or have tested positive and I was always careful and washing my hands. My week leading up to it was pretty low key.
@universalhub Honestly, May 4th looks extremely unrealistic, if not quioxtic to anyone with common senseThat being said, what's the new target date (May 15th? June 15th? "Indefinitely" until new #COVID19 cases are under 100?) And would requiring/enforcing masks in public make a difference?

The other part of this is also what a doubling of numbers means when you’re later in the epidemic as well #COVID19.At a very basic level, the difference between going from 25 to 50 cases over a set period of time (doubling time) is very different than when 500 becomes 1000 etc

I disagree. It hurts Russia more than the US if oil prices drop. Putin needs to keep oil prices high because the Russian economy is weak and unlike MBS he can’t afford to cut production. He needs  oil revenue. A price cut is bad for Russia! https://t.co/f2YrPYj37o

#COVID19 has shown the world what a failure of a president @realDonaldTrump is. He put the stock market the the rich above American lives. His inaction caused thousands to die, states and towns caught flat footed and hospitals to be severely short on supplies. Is this winning?

#Holiday April 19 celebrated on a nearest Monday, usually, since 1875, with a classically revived Marathon. The BAA Event is postponed this year due to #COVID19 risk to athletes &amp; spectators. Today's heroes are organized health's caregivers.

@marty_walsh @BOSTON_EMS Wonder if you are considering limits on bicycle riding. It’s fun for sure but any related accident takes our precious first responders and potentially hospital beds out of service to #COVID19 #pleasestayhome

I'm also curious about how confident we are that the #COVID19 death number isn't higher in Massachusetts. Has testing been done on all deceased since this began in USA? @MassGovernor
Today is the day that someone I knew personally died too young of #COVID19 . And tragically there will likely be many more. 💔Take care of yourselves, be kind to others and check in with friends and family to tell them you love them.
Yes!!! Bail out our kids! Not the banks Again!!  We need regulations now!! https://t.co/tDd1XAjcfD
