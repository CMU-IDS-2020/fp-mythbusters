Healthcare workers are at especially high risk for #COVID19 morbidly because the intensity of exposure to droplets is high. That exposure increases the probability of infection, but also the number of infectious particles inhaled.
There have been 54 new #COVID19 cases &amp; 20 deaths since yesterday in #NOLA. In just six weeks, COVID-19 deaths have now totaled more than three times the number of homicides last year. Please continue to take this seriously. #COVIDNOLA https://t.co/iQM0cOgGnR
