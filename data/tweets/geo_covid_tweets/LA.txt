Starting today Louisiana is sharing more data on @LADeptHealth dashboard. @LouisianaGov says we will not report data about race. 70 percent of all of the deaths in Louisiana from #COVID19 are of African Americans, which @LouisianaGov says is troubling.

Louisiana set a goal of 200k tests in the month of May. @LouisianaGov says we have completed 143,577 tests in May. ➡️ 56,000 to go to meet our #COVID19 testing goal with nine days to go in May.
Is there a reputable source to give to 1099 workers re: #COVID19 Federal aid?
.@LouisianaGov points out that Louisiana has a high number of cases based on population. Texas, for example, reported 39 cases. It has six times our population. That’s why he took the strong social distancing measures he did yesterday, of closing schools, etc. #COVID19

Day 7: Big spike in #Louisiana today. 537 #COVID19 cases and 326 in Orleans Parish. 1084 tested. 49.5% of those tested are positive. The numbers will continue to grow as more tested are given but accuracy in testing is important to chart where we are on the curve. 📈
The “storming” phase is normal, and is iterative as new people join and the nature of the work changes. As people mix up roles and responsibilities in response to #COVID19 I think it can be helpful to understand that conflict is a normal phase of group development.
@LouisianaGov officially extends stay at Home order through April 30th #coronavirus

Healthcare workers are at especially high risk for #COVID19 morbidly because the intensity of exposure to droplets is high. That exposure increases the probability of infection, but also the number of infectious particles inhaled.
There have been 54 new #COVID19 cases &amp; 20 deaths since yesterday in #NOLA. In just six weeks, COVID-19 deaths have now totaled more than three times the number of homicides last year. Please continue to take this seriously. #COVIDNOLA https://t.co/iQM0cOgGnR

I truly believe Louisianans as a whole took the Stay at Home order seriously and continue to take #COVID19 seriously, which is why it makes me angry when people question if their hard work was really necessary. Y’all saved lives by staying at home. That should not be downplayed.

I have not given up any freedoms or any rights staying home to protect others from #Covid19. It is my right as a true patriot to love fellow Americans and humans and not exercise my right to free movement or right to gather. And any other right that may risk the life of another

@tommy_carretta @NYGovCuomo This type of warning is seen all the time. It's a non liability statement. Common sense that masks will help in the containment of infectious spread. Company is stating they're not liable if you contract #coronavirus while wearing their companies masks.
No!  The state must release our citizens to get back to work!  No federal support, no increase in taxes, let the governor &amp;all politicians loose thier salaries for a year!  Don’t bailout states for this self inflected catastrophe.  Bad political decisions root, not virus https://t.co/L7iRyCsGwg
