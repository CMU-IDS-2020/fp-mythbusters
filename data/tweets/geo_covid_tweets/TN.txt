BTW Our #COVID19 numbers are behind the actual timeline. We test now then find out 5 days later. So the numbers we get today are how many + cases we HAD 5 DAYS AGO!Plus it takes the virus up to 12 days to appear in symptoms. Worse, people can spread it while showing no symptoms!

I have an idea for the shock and scare media. Instead of showing the bad cases and scaring people there won't be resources if they get sick. Why don't you investigate how the people got sick, got sick. Pin down exactly how #coronavirus is being transmitted to educate. Not scare
