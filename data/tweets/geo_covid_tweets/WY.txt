@whyyoumado @Jm53001721 @business Viruses don't usually  have "cures," just supportive care, antivirals &amp; vaccines. HepC could be one exception. #COVID19 has no developed antiviral or vaccine YET &amp; ALL of the meds being studied are not definitive treatment. Not to mention some experts believe it to be cyclical.
@Cinnamon305 @badeaux_mark @TheValuesVoter @steamtug7 #COVID is now part of our germ soup, it ain't goin' away. We have to learn to live with it. Thinking you can shut down the economy until there's a vaccine? Vaccines help against most viruses, in various degrees, but we don't know yet how much they will help against #coronavirus.

@TheValuesVoter @realDonaldTrump It was nice to read about something else for a change. I don't trust political spin for my #COVID19  information anyway. I'd prefer politicians and political talking heads kept their lies and cluelessness out of that information stream.
@ScottAdamsSays Agreed. Treating #coronavirus like the flu will kill many, many more people. Most of whom will be your age, Scott.

It actually shows how small the Democrats ideas are, &amp; how little They care about the AMERICAN people don't U think https://t.co/A6oGewvwRn
Last night I learned not to talk about my feelings drunk, and not to email my professor drunk. These are lessons I can thank #COVID19 for.
@johncardillo If they can do Contact Tracing and Forced Vaccinations...they can surely do Voter IDDemocrats want Election Fraud#coronavirus #LockdownEnd
@LokiLajett @sulelawrence @Monica_Michigan @cnnbrk Not to mention, based on other studies &amp; results around the world, the FDA would've been &amp; already were looking at this drug to treat #COVID19 before Trump spoke about it. Trouble is he misspoke on the approval sending misinformation signals AGAIN. He deserved criticism for it.
Steep trend. Just allow people to pay $10-15 a month for live tv on the ESPN app without tv provider sign in. Same with Fox and others. I cant see myself ever paying $60+ a month for a TV package when I don‚Äôt watch anything other than sports and Netflix. I don‚Äôt need 90 channels. https://t.co/b6e9dHM9cb

My colleague @TheMuddyTiger delivers a timely article on #Covid19 and the potential for water as a vector. The good news: while possible, it‚Äôs very unlikely for transmission by water in most cases. https://t.co/JS6o6HBVzt
I wonder how many quarantining babies were made during the #Covid19 pandemic.
Hey there Campbell County! Can you help us out with some more 100% tight-woven, pre-washed cotton masks: https://t.co/pK1s0N2vcq#coronavirus #covid19 #weareallinthistogether #flattenthecurve #StopTheSpread #masks #PPE #gillettewy https://t.co/C0xv8tpnPP

@Cinnamon305 @TheValuesVoter @steamtug7 So your eyeballs squirt Covid? Weird.They've already done the studies. You are slowing down transmission of #Covid19 to others if you wear a mask. If you have it and don't know it and don't wear a mask then you are sending it out to others.
Maybe if enough of them did end up with chronic pain, that would make a difference. Especially if they were Government officials, their families or loved ones. https://t.co/W9JdrlDpBZ
Asking for a friend: When are @BillGates &amp; the @WHO as well as the Chinese Communist Party going to be investigated for #CrimesAgainstHumanity for their involvement in all this? Plus all the other #eugenics projects? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS can you help me out here? #coronavirus

Yes, it's true. Everyone has a right to spew their #covid19 infected (possibly) spittle from Hell to breakfast and help force a new curve and with it additional lockdowns until the economy totally craters for the next FREAKING DECADE!https://t.co/8SW8vhKkZe
