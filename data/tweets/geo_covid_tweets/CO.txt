A lot of this presser is about #COVID19 testing. This is SO important: He added to expect the number of positive cases to jump in #Colorado in the next few days because they will be testing MORE people for #coronavirus. He said this is good  because it means it can be contained
@CarlosdelRio7 @WHO @Worldometers No available broad-scale testing = no accurate denominator of disease incidence. 50% of my patients came in with upper respiratory complaints yesterday. Many got a #flu swab. Not 1 got a #COVID19 swab because testing is EXTREMELY limited. #COVID19 is very much in the community.
#COVID19 is not just a public health or economic crisis but will be a crisis for the entire civil justice system.   This pandemic will change how our country operates and the legal system is paramount. Ken Frazier co-chair of the @LSCtweets Leaders Council

People are literally stealing boxes of masks from the hospital and selling them online for $50/box. Please leave masks for healthcare professionals who care for these patients and WASH YOUR HANDS. https://t.co/KM5ORDhFey

Today went to Pueblo to pick up the girls for the weekend. People were out. Parking lots were full. Lots of people not wearing masks. Gov. @jaredpolis‚Äôs attempt to lift restrictions while maintaining #SocialDistancing is not working. #coronavirus

See this report on how #Coloradans are affected by #COVID19- Majority support staying at home over reopening the economy- Young Coloradans &amp; those with low incomes share greater burden of pandemic impact- Hopeful the future will be better, but fear the worst has yet to come https://t.co/R6SCYB9pXN

@realDonaldTrump Please don‚Äôt talk too long tonight. Don‚Äôt tell us you know more that anyone in the world about Coronavirus. We want to see The Masked Singer!#coronavirus #COVID„Éº19

@christymaginn @adamfeuerstein Honestly I don‚Äôt know what the answer is. Many of our clients have been I/O &amp; Rare Disease focused in the last 4-5 years. If everyone goes the #coronavirus direction there will be a ton of competition to market. We need collaboration at this time.
So then the murder victim is probably classified as a covid related death- I‚Äôm sure https://t.co/5QzilVzkgz
