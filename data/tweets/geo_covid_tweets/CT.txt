People need to stop using the #COVID19 #pandemic as an excuse for being nasty and mistreating people. ESPECIALLY SERVICE WORKERS who cannot work from home and are serving them at risk to themselves and their families. #America should be better than that.
@GovNedLamont So am I going to get to sit in front of your office on May 20, telling everyone that walk by ... How you fail our state with the school and your @CTDCF Pick.. I will not knock you for #COVID19 but I will not let the world forget your broken promise to do right for the people
Need to rethink #COVID19 testing process @CDCgov for assisted living resident, 93 year old w/103 temp should not be transported to drive thru, why not deliver test to quarantined individual? Luckily #falsealarm no symptoms and is now 98.6..but..#CommonSense
A call for safety, a call for duty, a call for responsibility - it’s not about “The show must go on...” Its about what’s right... #doctors and gathering organizers must now practice #socialdistancing to help to slow the #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #COVID #coronavirus disease process. https://t.co/dPmwP5RhjJ https://t.co/ge6Kiq7YRR

I can appreciate being safe and careful. But I’m not sure why I see people alone in their cars driving on the highway with a #mask on. Seems unnecessary #coronavirus
Great piece, though methinks that we do need to highlight past experience with ARDS &amp; SARS more - odds are post ICU morbidities will be high &amp; potentially respiratory disease &amp; fibrosis - &amp; our healthcare systems are not ready for that! #COVID19 #Plan4TheFuture https://t.co/uGz82ICCBT

@tsankary @stuff_so I agree. Research indicates that to be the case. In fact, in China it does a better job of diagnosing in the asymptomatic/mild symptoms stage. You can then confirm CT scan positives with serum test, thereby avoiding running out of those tests. #coronavirus #COVID19 #medtwitter

@Technologic916 The “not wear a mask” comment is puzzling if he is treating patients. CDC guidance says the opposite. He is inviting infection. He will be spreading the infection to other patients. Masks help keep others from getting your illness. #coronavirus

@maryjames_13 That is happening with hospitals in Connecticut. Protective gear supply companies are not letting hospitals stock up. They are only filling their regular orders. I learned that from health officials at a #coronavirus roundtable here.
There will come a time when someone or someone they love will need a bed in a hospital due to an accident, heart attack, or other emergency and can't get one because they are filled with #coronavirus patients and then they will understand why it's such a big deal. #COVIDー19

Prevention is MOST important in this pandemic: 1. Detecting who has the disease now (Covid19 test) 2. Who had the disease already &amp; likely immune (antibody test &amp; 3. Who has been exposed to covid positives (cellphone tech) - we can limit spread of #Covid19 2/
7/ Their use of CT scanners as a screening test is also unreal. 200+ scans per machine per day. That’s a scan every 6-7 minutes. That is on level that most Western countries probably cannot/will not be able to replicate. (Separate thread on testing ⬇️) https://t.co/y7ImejEnMX

Breaking: WH has issued a statement saying that Trump has not been tested for #COVID19 I don't believe one word of that.What he can't do is admit to testing bc 'hoax'The President of the United States is exposed- he's tested.Even this President.He's such a liar.
