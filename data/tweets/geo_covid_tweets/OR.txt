Many restaurants are also helping, offering free meals for kids during the closure, including @laughingplanet. But several states, including Wash., have ordered all bars/restaurants to close because of #COVID19. Will OR do the same? #DanMcKATU has the details at 5 am #LiveOnK2.
Routines are off. Our lives are different. Set timers, and if you need help getting your prescription, reach out.

@DavidDTSS @HalfOnionInABag I don‚Äôt think these protests are going to really do much to #COVID19 numbers.  Outdoor transmission is far more difficult.

Hey #scitweeps, I‚Äôm looking for resources on science policy news/communication, especially as we see questionable/sketchy practices emerging regarding #COVID19 efforts in the private scientific and medical communities (re: the scientist + billionaire ‚ÄúManhattan Project‚Äù team).
Republicans point to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúclosure‚Äù of China travel as evidence of his bold, quick response to #COVID19. In the context of his proclamations, denials and failure to take any other action, Trump merely conveyed this was just a ‚ÄúChina‚Äù problem and did nothing to help US citizens
Since so many of us are working remotely from home during the #COVID19 #pandemic, we thank our #IamIH colleagues at NC State University for this helpful ergonomics guide for home offices. https://t.co/eIJpCT6ovK

@MatthewStiegler I read your post just shortly after reading another post about how #covid19 mutates in ways not previously considered. It may explain why people catch it again, that the antibodies work only for a given mutation? That we're fighting a family of viruses?

@OregonNurses rep says test kits for #coronavirus are in short supply and PPE (personal protective equip)could run low soon. She says hospitals are moving supplies out of sight so they‚Äôre not taken by visitors- keeping them safe for use. Talking to hospitals soon @KMTR @KVALnews
. @PMOIndia please make sure that all ministers avoid any unnecessary contacts and public meetings. Leadership getting contracted with #COVID19 will be a huge set back.
Remembering the cowpox led to the idea of the smallpox vaccine, I'm wondering if there is a virus that we could use.  Edit it a bit &amp; infect everybody, thereby confering immunity to #COVID19, but you get just a mild cold. I guess that's over our heads at this point in time.
Alternative math. How is Kellyanne? https://t.co/iIX714n6aa
@BillAckman just shut down the NYSE #circuitbreaker. nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one paranoid AF over the upcoming unmitigated fallout from #COVID19
White people...STAY THE FUCK HOME!!!#COVIDIOT #COVID19 #stayhome
If anyone out there is still looking for hand sanitizer, I used a porta-potty today and it was STOCKED full. #Covid19 #CoronaVirus
Has our Democracy women been trying to get along to much? I listen to Debbie Dingell this morning saying she doesn't like the word nationalist but we need to bring our jobs home. That WORD means way more than jobs. https://t.co/oHz1URZpvT
Shameful. Destroying fishing industries. Very very few cases. Open counties now. @OregonGovBrown https://t.co/cB5HnQ0xZm

Outstanding update on coronavirus. Keep 6 foot distance from others to prevent spreading #COVID19 to elders, children, and the vulnerable among us. Wear your mask when out. You can prevent deaths. https://t.co/UbcLouWToi

Gut wrenching to read and see this, while we are all pulling for each other, a good reminder that this hate still exists and can‚Äôt be tolerated. https://t.co/Af5mhqJNZG
Here is my attempt for animated graphical presentation of the spread of #COVID2019 in #USA. Plz maintain #SocialDistancing. Don‚Äôt be a #COVIDIOT. The bubble keeps getting bigger every day! #Covid19usa #coronavirus #CoronaOutbreak #Stayhomestaysafe https://t.co/FFAAfltycY
Bullshit. You are responsible for every single death from #covid19, along with that orange IT and all of his henchmen. https://t.co/Pf7VZr6GdE
tired of seeing all these BS from politicians and social media about social isolation and flattening the #COVID19 treatment curve. nobody in USA will voluntarily sacrifice their social life. either utilize military enforcement tactics to limit virus spread, or let it infect us.
I thought they were protesting because they didn‚Äôt want to wear masks...#covid19 #whiteprivilege #ProtestLockdown #morons #Cult45 #magaIf they were native, Mexican, black or any other brown skinned person they would have already been killed.https://t.co/Zmrs4EP7DO

‚ÄúOne of the most eye-catching changes in criminal behavior since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in Oregon is a shift in burglaries: figures show burglars are hitting offices and businesses, many of which are closed to preserve social distancing...‚Äù #COVID19 #Crime #Oregon https://t.co/QEMBXw4VDb

Apparently this is a high time for hacking. My Netflix account was logged into and stolen from me today at approximately 10:13 pm with all personal information... at least my bank has great customer service and I could block my card! #COVID19
