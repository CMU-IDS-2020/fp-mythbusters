Thank goodness for #coronavirus &amp; a run on TP. Arrive 12 hrs early and put in a door! (@ Roundy's Distribution Center - Perishable Dept. in Oconomowoc, WI) https://t.co/1cxiC49ZSg
The number one reason I ignored #COVID19 and voted was to send a message to @BernieSanders - exit the race now, please #WisconsinPrimary https://t.co/NzIHNALEMc
Well yeah we had the most cases so... https://t.co/eyUouMEKnq

As many celebrate #Easter at home and away from spreading #COVID19, it struck me again how far some are from the original teachings. #WWJT (What would Jesus Think?) The virtual displays of huge cathedrals with marble floors and expensive wood pews https://t.co/6KzfyPIDZd https://t.co/RdcssBN5mG
Wow, read this thread to get an idea of what home care for #COVID19 involves, and some good suggestions. https://t.co/wzh5izbh2t
@GenevievePeters I'm sorry you got sick after calling #COVID19 a hoax and refusing to wear a mask.Karen is as Karen does.
@realDonaldTrump Not you, bud. https://t.co/thoYXLPdAX

@mitchellvii I would LOVE to admit Trump is the GOAT, it'd mean we did beat #covid19. But alas, his "wish it away" strategy has failed #TrumpDeathToll100K https://t.co/xbbDQcSUV1
Good. https://t.co/55w1Yp9PEs
The US Census Bureau estimates 5,822,434 live in Wisconsin. @DHSWI says we‚Äôve tested 10,089 for #COVID19. That means we have tested 0.17% of the state for this disease. https://t.co/wAgwPJAkCH
Wow. Some awesome work here and some great reminders for us all on this Holy Day. #Together #Love https://t.co/o1PTIpx8h1

Is it bothering anyone else how people are saying they‚Äôre in quarantine when they‚Äôre really just sheltering in place? (I know this is not a big deal but it still is bothering me!) #COVID19

It‚Äôs Mid afternoon here and I am just putting up my feet to recharge for 30 mins. And on Twitter. No recharge. Just epic concern. How are you all doing? #COVID19 #StayHome #norest

https://t.co/moDvLerxmK  81% of the #COVID19 deaths in #Minnesota came from nursing homes. Gov. Tim Walz‚Äôs response is pathetic &amp; worse than #Cuomo. Walz should be under a federal investigation. If you have friends in MN, make sure they give Gov. Walz some hell! #wiright #walz
By not allowing it to wash through, like every other virus, we have done nothing but prolonged its existence for reasons as yet unknown. We will get the truth out. https://t.co/vRYxJqgEVg
As we move to a new stage of #COVID19 response with many states opening up over #MemorialDayWeekend, I have to say #QuarantineLife definitely had a smell ... and taste. My latest column via @VanguardPubAfrs üëáüèºhttps://t.co/OIILCJnyA9
We‚Äôre all in this together, and it is now more important than ever that we set partisanship aside so we and stay the course to overcome the public health and safety threat posed by this #COVID19. Wisconsin‚Äôs health and economic well-being depend on it. https://t.co/sChLPh6IqA

I have to eat and feed my ADA Service Dog. My back is messed up from a slip and fall at @cuboulder, and I am not getting any nibbles on remote jobs. Do the late fees just pile up until I magically get more income? I have multiple panic attacks a day worrying about this. #COVID19

I‚Äôm finding it fascinating that a few weeks to months ago LOTS of people (average members of society, media, celebrities, etc.) were calling for @POTUS to lockdown entire country for #covid19 &amp; were quite adamant about it.#coronavirus #coronavirusUSA 1/4
Good thing those #COVID19 testing sites are up and running. https://t.co/sCPvn8BS0x

Some info on the complex piece of equipment that is helping to save critically ill #COVID19 patients across the world - the R860 ventilator. @Jimmie_Beacham takes me through a couple of critical issues that @GEHealthcare are navigating, in order to ramp up production. https://t.co/4geathrcOt
For record, in my understanding(albeit non-legal &amp; non-constitutional-scholar üòâ), the way our government system is set up @POTUS  can make recommendation but doesn‚Äôt have authority to either lockdown or open entire nation. 4/4#covid19 #coronavirusUSAhttps://t.co/tai1ym3Mph

So, someone explain to me how @POTUS has power to order #CoronavirusLockdown of entire nation but on the other hand does not have power to order it back open? ü§î#COVID19 #coronavirus #coronavirusUSA 3/4
Hey single &amp; queer aunties &amp; unckles/gunkles: Do Skype/FaceTime/Zoom hangouts with your niblings to give caregivers some relief. Even if we can‚Äôt come over to babysit, we can still help with some childcare needs from afar! #QuarantineAndChill #coronavirus
