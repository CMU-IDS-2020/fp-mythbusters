Here‚Äôs my take on #COVID19 ‚Äî We‚Äôre fortunate that this disease doesn‚Äôt have a high burden, and that the mortality rate is pretty low. The fact that this disease has migrated into our local communities means that our country is not prepared whatsoever to stop a deadly pandemic.
Let‚Äôs hope #Italy has turned the corner on #coronavirus.  Viva Italia! https://t.co/hriI5YjcxX
