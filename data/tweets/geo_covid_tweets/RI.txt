While we track the daily # of new #COVID19 cases, another important statistic is percent positives, since the number of tests vary. In #RhodeIsland, that number has been roughly 8% to 8.5% for several days. (And even that # needs context, since it depends on whom your testing.)

Top down government and healthcare system control over #COVID19 testing makes sense to flatten the curve. Only consumer driven tests and control of personal data will eradicate it.
