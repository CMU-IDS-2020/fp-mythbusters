@EWagsterPettus your mask must read ‚ÄúPRESS‚Äù in large bold letters across your face or you will be denied Capitol access. #msleg #msgov @MSStatewatch #hazardpay https://t.co/RyIRAekYNE
A great word from @clunsford @EchoChurchIndy ‚ÄúWhen the enemy is surrounding you, you need to know, that God‚Äôs surrounding the enemy, God has you! He is surrounding what might be surrounding you today!‚Äù #coronavirus #life #echochurch #Indy
I hate that we are wasting time on what could have happened or could have been done with re: to #COVID19 and not focusing on what happens next. I hate this.

It‚Äôs almost like...they don‚Äôt need the gym after all ü§Ø https://t.co/e1nmtFULnh
There's something disturbing about politicians transparently adhering to the talking points/messaging memos they got advising them to discuss #COVID19 in terms of "warfare," "soldiers," "warriors," etc. Again: My 91-year-old granny isn't a soldier and shouldn't have to be. https://t.co/89JO23eUeN
We are fine but we are not in a highly populated NOR heavily tourist travelled area... still taking precautions but doing fine. Still going to the office everyday, but major cleanse when get there and leave. https://t.co/R0r4PpkK2O

.@SenHydeSmith @SenatorWicker @reptrentkelly People with #cysticfibrosis need additional protections during #COVID19. Please act to expand paid leave and increase Medicaid funding to support people with chronic conditions and their caregivers.
People need to hear this. https://t.co/ymHqiFMtsa
Thank you Governor @tatereeves. We know this executive order cannot slow the spread by itself.  We as Mississippians have to do our part as well. #StayHomeSaveLives https://t.co/hvU8lpMGPw
The Governor must take more aggressive actions to prevent further mass spread of the virus. #COVID19 is is a serious virus and it doesn‚Äôt care who you are, what you look like or where you come from.  It is spreading too rapidly throughout our communities. https://t.co/AN9fZDd5oj
