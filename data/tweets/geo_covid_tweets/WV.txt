So @WVGovernor and his cronies can't do math. They shut down our entire state over 1/10th of 1 percent of the tested cases dying. I don't want to see anyone die of anything.

So according to @senatemajldr President Trump easily distracted from his work &amp; incapable of multi-tasking?  That's a pretty poor endorsement Mr. Majority Leader; will @POTUS &amp; the @GOP ever forgive you?  #coronavirus #COVID19 #pandemic https://t.co/ZstNLtNt8J

@nicolegv3 @StrongmanNBest @AfroMarv @8NewsNow Actually yes kinda. Procedure goes as follows: first we test the swab for flu (if it's ➕ then we stop), if ➖ then we test for RSV (➕ = 🛑), if ➖ then we test for #COVID19. Co-infection rate less than 0.1%. So yeah, they do test for the same thing. It's the same swab.

He has no clue about the use of such a thing for it’s actual, direly needed *utility*. One serious possibility is that he was moving to shut it down because he believed he had made Fauci “famous”, and the doctor wasn’t sufficiently appreciative.
