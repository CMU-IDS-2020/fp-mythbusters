Still cautiously optimistic this current wave will end by 18th of May in the US. #SocialDistancing and other measures are having a huge impact. We will hopefully avoid the worst predictions and fall short of 60k deaths this wave. We currently have over 30% of all #COVID19 cases.

Dear @Instacart!My parents  live in a hotspot of #covid19  in #NYC  and are afraid of going to the grocery store . They are high risk. They tried your service today to order over $70 in food.THE STORE ONLY HAD 3 ITEMS.
This has the potential to be a big problem across the state as we reopen the economy. To return to work, parents need to know their children are safe and cared for. https://t.co/YqgZMBHLlF
