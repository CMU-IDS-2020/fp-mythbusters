Under “normal” circumstances I wash my hands constantly, clean my phone, glasses and other personal items with alcohol wipes two or three times a day. Since #COVID19 is airborne, I’m literally afraid to go outside. This may seem like an overreaction, but I’m not ready to die.

@medicalaxioms Very worried indeed. I am barely in favor of using it - as a trial - in confirmed hospitalized cases of #covid19. For mild, unproven, prophylactic indication is nonsensical, potentially dangerous (HCQ high dose + azithro + elderly ➡️ QTc prolongation), and depletes stockpile
Only 57 of #Alabama 's 67 counties have #COVID19 testing sites. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. And @RepMoBrooks is having a sissy-fit because #KayIvey won't reopen the state. Our numbers of #coronavirus cases has to be so skewed...BECAUSE WE CAN'T TEST THOSE WHO NEED IT.

People think I am overreacting because our state has no #coronavirus yet. I don’t care. The thing about people who were kids with chronic illness is that we’re good - after a lifetime of being different - at standing up to bullies.
I wear two medical devices - so I walk around with the chance of infection most days. Add any virus to the mix - especially one as deadly as #coronavirus - and I’m screwed.

Many people with chronic illness are very afraid of getting the flu or colds in a normal year, so in a weird way we’re more prepared for #coronavirus than others. We’re always on alert. We move away from the sick coughers in public spaces and don’t fly often to avoid getting sick

Anybody who thinks Trump isn’t doing anything to help battle the #coronavirus is an idiot. Are you idiots paying attention to the actions he is taking to expedite the production and delivery of needed medical supplies? #COVID19
What is so sad in all this is the media feeds on what New York is. Our local media outlets aren’t any better. People - the country isn’t like NYC - we have to stop giving them attention like a spoiled child. #coronavirus #mediafails @ffweekend
Y’all someone pls talk some sense into my mom. I swear she has the #CoronaVirus.She has a dry cough, no runny nose, but she can’t check if she has a fever bc the thermometer is broken. She’s saying how she’ll just “wait it out.” Oh, also—she traveled last week to Georgia. #LivePD
I’m beginning to think #COVID19 is a plague from @thegoodgodabove to take out the MAGA contention. Let them have their rallies and infect each other!
Hi, faculty using @Blackboard: I’d like to help w/ #COVID19 prep if I can. I’ve used Bb for many years. If you need to learn the basics fast &amp; your institution is crazy busy (who isn’t?), let me know. I, &amp; I know our exemplary course program team, would love to help. DM pls.

New York City loses over 800 people a day before #COVID19 - so are they including those deaths in the totals for #coronavirus death numbers? If you don’t think a liberal will make up these numbers you’re not paying attention.

Two ”What If” questions are going through my head for store/churches during this #coronavirus crisis that has forced us into #socialdistancing.  Questions revealed in this thread.
I just wish this plague hadn’t chose to appear during pollen season. Sinus drainage causes coughing and spreading germs.#COVID19 #StayHomeSaveLives #QuarantineLife
@CDCgov @WHO I would like to ask, the people that have passed from the #coronavirus what were their ages? Just curious? I haven't heard this mentioned? @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews
@RandPaul Rand Paul is a greedy asshole and this is karma. I don’t care!! He got the virus because he voted AGAINST people getting help from the government not once, but twice!! Screw him. People like him don’t care until they HAVE to. #coronavirus #COVIDIOTS #StayHome #SocialDistancing
I would like them to also update how many test results have been received. Are they trickling in? Have thousands of results now been received and only 12 cases? That seems like a no-brainer but after watching the state Health Dept press conferences I won't hold my breath. https://t.co/FyqRm4vWg8
