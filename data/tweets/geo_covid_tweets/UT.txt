.@MetLife are you going to give credit or refund your auto insurance customers like many of your competitors or are you going to just keep the money and still raise rates during the #COVID19 epidemic? Asking for your customers, including myself, who can really use the money.
@BYUapologist My thoughts are the @UFCW is more behind this using the #COVID19 pandemic to wage war against the free market. People need to realize #OrganizedLabor is a corporation similarly geared “for profit” all the same. They’ll resort to manipulations as any company.
We ALL have the same obligation to protect each other especially during times like these. 💙#coronavirus #AloneTogether

@DylanCMcDonnell Exactly. Social isolation is also problematic for many of our families for a variety of reasons. The concerns I’ve been stressing are systematic...#COVID19 has only enhanced them. #utleg #utpol
So the @beansandbrews in Murray decided this morning that #COVID19 isnt real? Not a single employee wearing a mask in-spite the impossibility of working a take out window and staying 6 feet away. Manager said "we dont do that here" when I asked her where their masks were.

You know what would be awesome? If @Fanatics would allow you to buy a  cloth face mask 3-pack of a mix whatever teams you wanted, instead of a 3-pack of just one team. I’d totally grab a @dodgers @49ers @utahjazz 3 pack so quick! #coronavirus #Covid19

It is unfortunate that the 3 highest days for confirmed #COVID19 cases in Utah since it was tracked were today, yesterday &amp; Thursday - 2 weeks after state lowered restrictions. I know marching for equality is VITAL but seems like it will have health consequences afterwards.
