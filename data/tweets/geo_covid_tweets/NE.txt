@VividSeats_Help I am very disappointed and rather angry at @VividSeats refusal to issue refund to @NBA @Lakers @HoustonRockets game.  My wife is on the front lines containing #COVID19 in our community. There won’t be any mass gatherings for a long time. Who can I appeal to?

Yes! The #coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread across 100+ countries and killing 4,700+ people, started *explicitly* so that the US economy would go into a recession and, most importantly, give people a reason to see Trump is a terrible president.
