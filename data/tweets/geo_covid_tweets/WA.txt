14 Days After Distancing: Seattle Shows Signs for Hope https://t.co/HGBqVQksKe via @YouTube by @BenJMcFarland #COVID19 #remotelearning  @SeattlePacific
Fuck you #Coronavirus my sister just lost her job completely!!!
#COVID19 has always been a global health crisis, now it‚Äôs a national security threat. What‚Äôs happening to the #usstheodoreroosevelt is a tragic disgrace. This shortsighted lack of proactive leadership has failed these brave sailors deployed in defense America #CoronaLockdown https://t.co/egZXqjIP1w
Really... https://t.co/Wn6QJPvysB
It‚Äôs a different world with this much access to reporting channels and consuming media. It‚Äôs SO real time. I‚Äôm almost hitting information overload. https://t.co/PVtklXOQaY
Again, if you are going to wear a mask in public, wear it. If you‚Äôre going to let it hang off of your chin and touch your face, there is no point in wearing the mask. You‚Äôre just using up a supply that medical folks and infected people actually need. #coronavirusseattle #covid19
This is the kind of innovative treatment that is going to save many, many lives! #COVID19 https://t.co/ImArltCGlS

Through all of this, there is absolutely no sign that #coronavirus is slowing or under control.

It‚Äôs only the second time in See‚Äôs 99-year history that production has been interrupted, the first being when it was halted due to rationing during World War II. #COVID19 https://t.co/d7BhPrSUHO
#COVID19 is affecting us in many ways. Presently, our economy and everyone who has been looking for a job (me). In the future, it‚Äôll affect our hobbies and simple enjoyments: movies and tv shows. No one is filming rn, therefore, all of our shows won‚Äôt return until ~2022
Educators are truly amazing people. And the epitome of collaborative, as the global sharing of resources happening right now from in states once again. ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù seems inadequate, but there it is. Sincere gratitude from this corner of the world! #edchat #COVID19 #goalearning

The creepiest part of all this #coronavirus stuff, is that I‚Äôve never taken I-5 thru Tacoma MORE than I have this week, due to lack of traffic. It‚Äôs rather mind boggling that it takes a pandemic for traffic to be moving at reasonable levels. I‚Äôd still rather deal w/ the traffic.

I‚Äôd like to applaud @GovInslee on his statewide address this evening.  It was FDR-esque in its personal reach into our homes. Proud to live in #WA where our state government is taking decisive action, but also comforting us with measured leadership.  #firesidechat #COVID19

One thing this pandemic has shown me is that if we're ever confronted with a really severe pandemic, one with a virus that has a high mortality rate, the deep south will be wiped out in the first weekend.#COVID19

Bill Gates says Trump's decision to halt WHO funding is 'as dangerous as it sounds'. "Their work is slowing the spread of #Covid19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever."https://t.co/UaBakxQUqh

@Slivovitza007 @JordanLynch1892 @PhildoMurphy @johnrobertsFox @EmilEEEElime @realDonaldTrump Not likely! If I get #COVID19, I will not ask for a drug that could possibly do me more harm than good! Nor would by doctor even consider prescribing it since it's not FDA approved and his medical license to practice is! #SillyTroll

@GovInslee please explain how it happens the coronavirus prefers blue states over the red states, as you CONTINUE to punish the people of Washington with your UNSCIENTIFIC and INSUFFERABLE 3+ months of lockdown...except for the big stores, of course!! https://t.co/iiujIergNg
At a moment when Americans most need Washington to look out for them and cut the partisan drama, Democrat leaders once again chose to put their far-left base first.¬†#Corruption#OBAMAGATEGATE#CoronavirusOutbreak#COVID19#QANON#WWG1WGAhttps://t.co/576n7NTP8H

We are at war, us human beings versus the ideas and wealth of the old way of doing things before #COVID19.  Every community has lost lives and has many more lives at risk.
