While working at my @Safeway store, an Asian man conversing with one of my associate’s said “you know, every time I cough people run away from me.”This is why you don’t call #COVID19 a Chinese virus. This is why the racist bigotry persists when pushing a nationality as a virus.
Between 160 million and 214 million people in the US could be infected with #COVID19 over the course of the epidemic. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million could die.The US population is 327.2 million. So not panicked enough. https://t.co/E84CgJLZTx

@colvinj @JonLemire This study is a bogus attempt to prevent use of HCQ in #COVID19.1) It’s a retrospective study. Not the gold standard prospective study.2) Known: Z-Pak and CQ less heart stable than HCQ. Hence, already used scarcely.3) Study likely banned good results: e.g., HCQ+Remdesivir.

@realDonaldTrump #COVID19 No, you’re doing a TERRIBLE job. Ask the family members that have lost loved ones due to your inaction, slow response, etc.  Not seeking advice or info from your  predecessors is a clear sign of your ignorance and lack of care for the American people.

@amerix do you think the way death are reported #COVID19 is being given undue weight.  Am just wondering if someone with other underlying issues dies , why say its #coronavirus that has killed him/her?
In 6th week of adult #COVID19 care what’s killing me slowly inside is my elderly patients being refused what they need most-the loving touch and IN-PERSON contact of their family &amp; friends. They are no different than my youngest #PedsICU patients. It’s keeping me up at night.

#COVIDー19 #coronavirus New York State on Wednesday reports a record high 779 daily new deaths due to COVID-19. Health workers wheeled the body of a deceased coronavirus patient from the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center on April 4. https://t.co/sNC0RQ2OLO
"Across the 366 counties we examined, there were on average 51 more deaths per 100,000 people than the average for the same period in 2014–2018. If this rate held against the entire US population of 328 million, this would amount to over 167,000 excess deaths this year to date." https://t.co/tsmFCMzTUG

In times of crisis like #COVID19 it exposes the deep problems of populism. It’s not about my country or blaming “the other”. It’s about global cooperation &amp; mutual solidarity, supporting global institutions like @WHO, sharing information &amp; resources.
If we’re putting a hold on church gatherings &amp; school days &amp; days at the office, and allowing 200 people to congregate on a single block to conduct business as usual, more preventative measures need to be taken to prevent the further spread of this virus. #COVID19 https://t.co/ie37n5sLmz

I’ll add 1 more thing- there’s a misperception that non-pharm intvns for #delirium are always “extra work”- but it is really about extra teamwork. We can’t expect it to be all on nursing- the whole team has to coordinate &amp; facilitate-&amp; often has short term benefits too!! #COVID19 https://t.co/wFyP2jWJ8z
@GovLarryHogan So the problem is even if Maryland gets #coronavirus under control, people can simply drive or fly into the state. We need National leadership. We need nationwide testing and contract tracing.

@realDonaldTrump Nobody knows whether Trump is telling the truth when he says he has taken the #COVID19 test. Nobody will believe him if he says the tests are negative. The public needs documentary evidence to support his claims. Nobody with any sense trusts a proven liar!

The concept of “baby lung” in #COVID19 discussion still makes my #PedsICU #PedsAnes brain go 😣 &amp; IMHO detracts from the rapidly changing #respiratory dynamics of childhood development. Also, since when is a 6-year old a baby? (Read 1st paragraph)https://t.co/zMtK0SdXwz https://t.co/AI56nTFtCm
Newsflash Dr. Segal: The scrubs were a statement. They did not take care of a #COVID19 patient and run out onto the street. Not all scrubs are operating room scrubs.
