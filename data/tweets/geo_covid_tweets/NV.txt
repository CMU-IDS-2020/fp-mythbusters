Again, a ‚Äúface covering‚Äù is NOT a ‚Äúmask.‚Äù Those battling #COVID19 on the frontlines‚Äîincl. doctors, first responders, &amp; other essential employees interfacing with potential patients‚Äîdesperately need medical masks. DO NOT put their safety at risk by obtaining a mask you don‚Äôt need.
Today my Medical Advisory Team issued guidelines for using a face covering as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of #COVID19. A ‚Äúface covering‚Äù is not a surgical-grade or FDA mask like an N95, which is in short supply &amp; should be reserved for those who most need them.
