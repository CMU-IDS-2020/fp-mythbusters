In science, we calculate and prove hypotheses. It‚Äôs why we know so much about human-caused climate change. The same people who deny that science want to use magic to connect dots that #COVID19 escaped from a Chinese lab. That‚Äôs not how any of this works.
As a reminder: @realDonaldTrump still isn't providing #Covid19/#Coronavirus testing, and simultaneously saying the doctors and scientists are inflating death numbers to attack him. He is literally murdering us to be more popular. #TrumpVirus

@WeiZhangAtmos @AkshatRathi The way to interpret that graph is to understand that #Covid19 effectively will double a member of the general population chances of death in a single year as opposed to risk of death in previous years.

I left out the math behind how I came up with 0.5% US IFR for #Covid19. Here‚Äôs summary: NYC (which should be high) serology+ of ~22% or ~1.9M residents. 11,600 deaths but some still to come so assume 15k. 15k/1.9M=~0.8% IFR. CA numbers much lower. My guesstimate US IFR is 0.5%.

Dr. Donald J. Trump, MD, PhD, Esq. says he's great at scientific research. I reckon that's why he said the other day that his "hunch" was that the #coronavirus mortality rate was less than 1% instead of the 3.4% figure from WHO. His hunches are well researched stats, actually. https://t.co/q2Hi0dOWLJ
Discussing politics online is a distraction. It is a coping mechanism to keep our minds occupied as the #pandemic changes every aspect of our lives. Time to time, remember that our lives are not promised. Reality is needed to help prevent delusions. Do not forget #COVID19.
