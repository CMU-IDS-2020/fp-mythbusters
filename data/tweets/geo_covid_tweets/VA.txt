This isn’t intended to be a woe-is-me tweet as I’ve honestly got it great compared to so many. But i sold my car before moving to Manhattan. Haven’t gotten one since moving to Arlington.I’d relied on metro/Uber/walking to get around. #COVID19 makes me not use the first two.
My BF still has to go to work which means the alarm still goes off at 5 am. I usually can't go back to sleep once he leaves and the great thing about that is that I can start being bored early. #COVID19 #boredinthehouse
$spy @MorningsMaria Last week, the Chinese Govt was blaming Covid19 on the US Army. This week, they are trying to shift blame on the Italians. There’s a reason they are working hard to deflect with a Misinformation campaign:  the Chinese Govt has blood on its hands.   #Covid19

I wonder how the numbers of the #COVID19 cases will be affected by these protests.Wish the @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews would report the *trend* of #Coronavirus rather than the total.  I'm not even sure how the total is supposed to be helpful.  The trend tells us for we're doing.

With regards to this clip @CNN is playing of Trump talking with recovered #COVID19 patients who say that Hydroxychloroquine worked for them, the reason he hasn’t heard a bad story about the drug’s use is because those patients are DEAD. But yeah, not so bad I guess. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Remember friends: when Dr. #Fauci was asked whether #hydroxychloroquine could be used to treat #COVID19, he said, “The answer is no.” Goofus gets his medical advice from @realDonaldTrump. But Gallant gets his from real doctors. Don’t be a goofus!

Major #covid19 theme I’m noticing in the US today —“We’re looking to the CDC...” is the #okboomer of disconnected responsiveness and planning.“We’re translating what we have from WHO and the numbers here in the US and...” is the timely, knowledgeable source I’m confident in

@isharmeenali It’s more applicable (but not entirely true) for bacteria 🧫 (no so much for viruses). And in the case of #CoronaVirus I would beg to differ with the epidemiologist on your show. Viruses make colonies just like bacteria and are usually sufficient to infect a person.
