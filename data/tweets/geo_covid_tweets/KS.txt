#Coronavirus is just another nail in the coffin and not the coffin itself (for the fatties).
How many of the reported #COVID19 deaths are actually caused by the virus,as opposed to a death from an underlying condition then autopsy showing the the deceased also had Covid-19?Are the # of deaths solely based on those who died from the virus or those who died with the virus?

Over 83,000 people have died from the #Coronavirus because of ‚Äúsmall man‚Äù Trump. 33 million Americans are unemployed. And to try to distract from that, he makes up conspiracy theories about a President who left office almost 4 years ago. #TrumpDepression2020 https://t.co/J0RQIbZSBG

One thing that stands out to me as to why so many leagues are suspending/cancelling whole seasons is because they don't have anywhere to play. Mayors are invoking emergency laws to shut down mass gatherings (prudently) and restrict travel. Doesn't leave sports much choice. https://t.co/sb6tGJNO1i
