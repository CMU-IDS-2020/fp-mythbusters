A close family friend went to the ER with flu-like symptoms. The staff refused to test her for #COVID19 because she hasn’t (that she’s aware of) been around anyone who has tested positive for the virus.
I don’t know who needs to hear this, but...Before #COVID19 there has never been any event in American history - no war, no disaster, no drought, no famine, no attack, no pandemic, other than the 1918-1919 pandemic, that killed 40K Americans in a month.It isn’t the flu.

The scary reality of #COVID19 is that we are all hunkered down in fear waiting in most cases for a white man to tell us when it’s ok to go outside again. The practice of slavery has ceased but the structure of it persist.

Please shut it down, @GovKemp. The longer we wait, the worse this will get. We want to see our family, friends, &amp; neighbors on the other side.The swifter you act, the faster we will recover economically. If you don’t act, some of us will never survive this. https://t.co/gKz9FJZzfx

@NateSilver538 It seems to me that widespread serological testing for antibodies will be key to really getting back to something approaching normal. Even optimistic estimates, it’s a month away.  Once available there will be a lag to see a recovery. So July? Pessimism or optimism? #COVID19

@bridget_joy_ I’d prefer #COVID19 never happened but that’s as much a fantasy as thinking Americans can simply “go back to business as usual” with zero testing, zero contact tracing, zero antibody testing &amp; no vaccine. The incompetence of Trump is making it worse, more deadly &amp; last longer.
One day later: 800 cases and 26 deaths.  @GovKemp announced new restrictions today, but they don’t go far enough.  The smart, safe thing to do is require all non-essential businesses to close and GA to stay at home for at least the next 2 weeks to get #COVIDー19 under control. https://t.co/mtDfm1CQKX

“For immigrant youth &amp; families, and all families with low economic means...with school closures and a move to virtual learning, let us not forget the students and families potentially left behind because of their lack of internet access.” #COVID19 #GCIR2020 #CourageVisionAction
#Pepcid, a common drug to treat heartburn improves #covid19 symptoms? Hmm too early to tell. How about #zoloft on FDAs list of shortage medications? That’s good. Hopefully a sign more people are seeking mental health care, during these tough times!

When @aboutKP told us to go to get checked for #COVID19 at the ER, and after they sent an email assuring us that there would be “No cost for COVID-19 care,” why’d I get a bill from @PiedmontHealth for $1101.10? I’m guessing because healthcare in the US sucks?
Maybe this is a sign we all need to slow down, stop putting emphasis/energy on things truly not pertinent, and put energy/resources/effort into things we truly need. Because a simple virus just changed the world, it’s operation, and well being. #MarchMadness #COVID19 #America

This is the problem. MANY undetected cases that are not being tested and confirmed. Community spread is occurring without being warned because there is not enough testing. Social distancing is necessary. https://t.co/GhdW3mN9Pm
Just a reminder that the poor and uninsured have little to no options when it comes to #coronavirus.Most don't have jobs where they can simply work from home. A lot of people in this burgeoning economy of ours are working service jobs. No customers, no work, no pay.

@trudygonzales I went to a private clinic with a badcold/flu/whatever yesterday, just 3.5 miles from the CDC in Atlanta. I didn't THINK it was #coronavirus (I don't have a fever) but I was disappointed that they had no test available for me. Not sure WHAT the protocol is for testing, if any.
So if we can all start calling this #coronavirus the Kung flu, that would be great...

The objective is to provide researchers a better understanding of spreading patterns of #COVIDー19 and to clarify the common misunderstandings in this regard.#coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #Epidemic #covid19outbreak
I can’t figure out why @CNN keeps saying that the #coronavirus numbers in Georgia are “flat”. It sure looks like a V to me. The dots in the shaded area are preliminary &amp; always go up as test results come in. https://t.co/6ZxbFrupMq
2 things: 1) OF COURSE @realDonaldTrump makes this about him. Pretty sure the spread of #COVID19  caused a potential date change, not his endorsement.2) Wisconsin’s governor’s a Dem, but the state is really run by a GOP Congress (who gutted gov’s power before he took office) https://t.co/7ckesXlV2k
But the real question is, weren’t we all kinda wearing masks in public anyway, before Covid? And have we now learned the value of being real? #Covid19 #wearingamask #besafe #weareinhistogether #bereal

Really awesome. @Delta wants to be understanding during #COVID19 pandemic, they really want to charge $150 fee to cancel, when the flight was only $250. What the literal fuck. I'd wager flight get canceled anyway. Guess I'll wait it out.
So why did the Senate pass the bill then if it's still got amenities for #illegal and the #KennedyCenter what do they have to do with #coronavirus, don't those people in #Congress work the American people #TheFive

@FckDemKids Exactly. My thoughts exactly. Every since March 31st I’ve been doing daily updates follow the numbers of #Covid19 (via @JohnsHopkins) in the State of Georgia. And it baffles me how we have not flatten the curve yet but are resuming regular day functions like everything is fine.
Before #COVID19 I spoke with a friend about how no one interacted, y’all basically isolated yourselves putting in your headphones and didn’t even batter an eye to those around you. After this I hope you pay attention and carry a convo with the person who complimented your smile.

If you’re buying the “we’ve reached the #COVID19 peak” narrative, some facts: Today was the 2nd highest “new case” count &amp; *by far* highest death count. We passed 400K total cases. It took 66 days to our 1st 100K cases, 6 days to our 2nd 100K, 5 days to our 3rd, 4 days to our 4th

@StefanKertesz This is very unfortunate. From what I have read #Covid19 can have dire consequences for all age groups, and it is not just respiratory. Deaths from strokes and heart attacks caused by blood clots are reported as well as long term problems like chronic pain. No one is immune.

@BrianKempGA The steps you have taken to stem the spread &amp; impact of #COVID19 are not nearly enough. It’s not too late to do something; listen to the experts and shut down the state. Do you want to be remembered as the governor who let hundreds if not thousands of Georgians die?
475 deaths in one day in Italy! #coronavirus . This is extremely serious.

@GaDPH again I ask. The “unknown” county number is now 178. That’s a big number. I find it hard to believe they aren’t asking County when testing. Are these military? The counties have a right to know if they show 9 but it’s actually 100. #COVID19
Thanks https://t.co/cT0sE9fQjD
We’re at &gt;13,000 confirmed cases of #CoronaVirus now. Two factors are responsible for the sharp rise: more actual cases &amp; more testing. My guess is the additional testing is probably increasing at about the same rate as transmission.

What if we find the nature of #COVID19 spread makes high density shelter at home in cities more risky than going outside with a mask and countermeasures? Seems there’s some evidence suggesting this.

“Exposure” or “exposed to” does not mean contracted or transmitted. When you read “180 people were exposed,” it doesn’t even mean they were within six feet. It means they came within an ambiguous proximity. Words mean things. Even deceptively. #covid19

@RyanBPetersonMD Absolutely. I have no desire (nor skill) to discover signs. I’ll leave that to pros. I do believe though it is possible though that people will have time to find nuanced patterns and uses for imaging in #covid19.  I just don’t believe it’s been fully fleshed out yet.

The #coronavirus is a political stunt to promote good hygiene. Dont give in
When @realDonaldTrump can't control a situation you see how inept his leadership is. #coronavirus cannot be bought, cannot sign a #NDA and cannot be spun by #FoxNews. It doesn't read #Twitter either.
