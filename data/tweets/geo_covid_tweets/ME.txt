If #SARSCOV2 infects as many that the @CDCgov says will contract the seasonal flu (est 31 million),  #COVID19 would kill 10,850,000 people (yes, that is millions), if the current mortality rate for COVID-19 (35%) stays the same. Flu deaths are est to be between 12,000 and 30,000.

One phrase I‚Äôm tired of is ‚ÄúNo one knew this would happen.‚Äù Because people knew. Lots of people. Many many people. There was a friggin documentary. Bill Gates was talking about it 5 years ago. I think we even had a federal department at one point? Hmmm. #COVID19 #DailyBriefing

This is NOT a test. Please stay isolated. For real. Do it for yourself, and everyone else. Very soon, our hospitals won't have enough beds for patients. Use Skype and Facetime. Catch up on reading, hobbies, resolutions. Be kind. #FlattenTheCurve #SocialDistancing #coronavirus
