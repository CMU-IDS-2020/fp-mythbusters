Just for comparison, here are the assumptions from V1. R-naught is much higher (how many new cases are contracted from a single source) and ICU stay is way down. https://t.co/EyMErJthAo https://t.co/LWiYfiBaTD
Sure, public libraries are closing as a precaution. But think about how low the circulation numbers will be from Little Free Libraries. Better wait an average of nine days before checking that book out. #COVID19
ICU use is back to its highest level yet (130 beds) for #covid19 in Minnesota. We should not be talking about reopening.

@realDonaldTrump, Mr. President, masks just work. And, making masks mandatory, can be a way of getting Americans back to work. That in turn will reduce the costs of this epidemic. Sir, set the example, and get America wearing masks. #maskswork #coronavirus #covid19 @VP
The #coronavirus does not kill only soldiers. It does not care if you pick up a gun or drop a bomb. It does not care if you mass produce weapons of war to defend your nation. It's an invisible enemy, one that benefits from our laissez-faire approach to defeating it.

Now is NOT the time to ease #COVID19 restrictions. In fact, now is the time to double-down on our efforts to prevent spread. The US is at a key inflection point, and the outcome of this pandemic truly depends on each one of us.
