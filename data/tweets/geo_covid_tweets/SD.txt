Iif you‚Äôre exhibiting symptoms of #coronavirus, will getting a test or the lack thereof change how you are treated?  Since there‚Äôs no ‚Äúcure‚Äù I‚Äôm just wondering what the significance of the test really amounts to. Just a tracking tool?

Here‚Äôs a question. Do governors who  decline to issues stay at home orders  like @govkristinoem to battle #COVID19 and deaths result from that, open themselves up for legal liability? How about Smithfield Foods?

Two months ago there were few deaths from the virus. Today there‚Äôs over 40,000. There‚Äôs not enough tests to even determine who is infected. Reopening society too quickly will cause the 9 deaths in SD to potentially rise higher. Push for adequate testing and contact tracing first! https://t.co/JHI1nHRyTw
