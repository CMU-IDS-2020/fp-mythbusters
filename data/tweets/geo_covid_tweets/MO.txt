#COVID19 is so challenging because it has high infectivity and mortality rates. Infectivity is measured by its R0 (R naught) number. This describes how many people will be infected by a diseased person. If the number is less than 1, then the disease will die out. (3/x)
At this point, we are just trying to survive...#GoCats #coronavirus https://t.co/BEqwCdQTQy

Think of human beings like a weed. The weed that looked cute until it began to take over. The weed that puts life on this planet at risk. We find a way to stop the weed or Earth dies. Unless the weed decides to change for the better, it is not  beneficial for the garden. #covid19

@realkatiejow Well, 2 concerns:1. How exactly would you know you aren't carrying it? #COVID19 spreading starts 2 days BEFORE symptoms.2. By going out, you could catch it from an asymptomatic spreader, then about 2-14 days after that, you will start spreading.So those are your 2 big fails.

So one reason why #COVID19 is such a big deal is it has a high morbidity--meaning number of those that require hospitalization if they catch it--and this could be as high as 20%, but even 10% is very high. The USA has 2.8 beds per thousand population. Do the math.

If a university forces students go home and finish online due to fear of #Coronavirus they should pro-rate a refund for room and board AND allow a student to drop the class with a full refund.

I totally disagree with this kind of rhetoric.  And that's all it is... Baseless claims posed as facts. Do not confuse the theatrics with @JoeBiden's track record.  Under #JoeBiden we will have a #POTUS who understands that the flu vaccine only works for the flu NOT #CoronaVirus https://t.co/jNdaHSfjIt
