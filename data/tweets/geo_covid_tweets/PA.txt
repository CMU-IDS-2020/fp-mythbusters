@realDonaldTrump @RonaldKlain That's awesome man, and your #coronavirus ratings are surely the most important thing to all of us right now.

@mcuban easiest way to stop #coronavirus shut all things down. Have agents test everyone in the state. Shut down all travel between states. Now we have all infected people. Then reopen Said state. Barring all travel. 200 days of non travel. Back to normal.

@EdwardPentin Hi Edward.   Although, I agree that it is important to protect the public at large against the spread of #COVID19, I can‚Äôt help but to notice, that @Pontifex &amp; the #vatican, ARE capable of taking swift &amp; decisive actions.  If only they moved this fast for their victims of abuse.
For Pittsburghers who want to help their neighbors, consider making a donation to the @PghFoodBank. A gift of only $100 buys 1000 meals for those whose lives have been affected by #COVID19. A gift helps the kids who depend on their schools for meals; don‚Äôt let them go hungry.

@WhiteHouse It seems that the jobs lost help slow the spread of #COVID19 , so yes go America. It also seems that the "spike" you see and claim as "jobs added" are those simply the American worker going back to work. So I ask, are they really 'added"? @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/gCkdOo5B9O
In order to get ahead of #COVID19 we need a president who will humble himself, be sacrificial/selfless, step aside, let the non-political experts lead, foster trust/unity among the public which is done through a commitment to justice for all: this is why we are in serious trouble

@PAHealthDept so let‚Äôs get this straight. You have no way of knowing how many people are cured but now you want to track every person someone with #COVID19 came in contact with?  Good lucky with that. It seems as if your math skills already need worked on.

I once had double pneumonia. I was in my late 30‚Äôs, in decent shape, leading a pretty healthy life.I lay there, aching with a 104¬∞ fever, crashing from freezing cold to burning up and back, struggling to breathe.And I thought, ‚ÄúI can see how people die from this.‚Äù#COVID19
